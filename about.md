This blog follows my adventures learning about computer networking by designing
and implementing my own networking stack, as well as some necessary appliances
(switches, routers, etc.). This is enabled by a network simulation layer that
allows me to lay out complex networks. The simulation cuts off some of the
lower-level details, primarily parts of the OSI physical layer.

The simulation makes use of the RPC protocol defined by Jane Street's async
package, which means that we will be working in OCaml anytime we need to talk
about code. Sorry!

Oh, you wanted to know about me? I'm a software developer at Jane Street Capital
in NYC. I previously worked at Trello and Fog Creek Software. I took half a
class on networking targeted at the CCNP certification, but decided that
building things would be more interesting than memorizing details about Cisco
devices.
